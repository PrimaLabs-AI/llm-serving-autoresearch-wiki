Set `use_fused_bwd_kernel=True` on the splash kernel but left the `block_q_dq` / `block_kv_dq` parameters configured. **Splash errored: `ValueError: Block sizes for dq kernel are not needed with a fused kernel`. Our XLA fallback path fired for every layer — the measured 32,027 TPS / 255.8 ms is XLA-attention, not splash-fused-bwd.**

## Hypothesis

The `use_fused_bwd_kernel=True` flag should combine Q/K/V backward into a single kernel call, saving dispatch overhead.

## What went wrong

The dq block-size parameters must be **omitted** (not set) when `use_fused_bwd_kernel=True`. My edit left them in place; splash raised at build time; my try/except in `splash_attention_fn` caught the error and fell through to the plain XLA attention path — invisibly, per call.

## Interesting side-finding

The XLA fallback number (32,027 TPS, 255.8 ms) is **within 2 ms** of the real splash path at this config. XLA's attention at seq=1024 is competitive with splash — the splash win scales with seq² and kicks in at longer sequences.

## Verdict

**REJECTED / INVALID.** This run measured the wrong kernel. The correct config landed in [exp 17](2026-04-23-exp17-splash-fused-bwd-accepted.md) with the dq params stripped. Not merged.
