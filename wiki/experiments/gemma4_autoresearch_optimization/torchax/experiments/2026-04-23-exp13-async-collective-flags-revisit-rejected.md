Re-ran [exp 1](2026-04-23-exp1-async-collective-flags-rejected.md)'s async-collective-fusion flag bundle on the new-best stack (splash + bf16 CE + batch=2 + selective remat). **Same regression as before: +12.7 % step time, 253 → 285.4 ms, TPS 32,340 → 28,700.** Confirms the regression is structural to this workload size, not an artifact of the pre-splash baseline.

## Hypothesis

With splash attention and larger batch, scheduling has more work to hide collectives behind — maybe the bundle that regressed at exp 1 will now win.

## Result

Refuted — the mechanism is the same: scheduler reorder breaks compute-fusion locality, convolution and loop fusion bytes blow up, the modest collective-overlap savings don't compensate.

## Profile

- **xprof browser URL**: [2026-04-23-gemma4-exp13-splash-bf16ce-async-flags](http://localhost:8791/?run=2026-04-23-gemma4-exp13-splash-bf16ce-async-flags) — opens the interactive trace viewer for this run.
- **Run name** (as listed by `mcp__xprof__list_runs`): `2026-04-23-gemma4-exp13-splash-bf16ce-async-flags`
- **On-disk directory**: [`raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-exp13-splash-bf16ce-async-flags/`](../../../../../raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-exp13-splash-bf16ce-async-flags/) (gitignored; relative link click-throughs open the trace folder locally)
- **Steps captured**: 10, 11, 12
- **What's inside**: xprof trace — async-collective bundle re-tested on splash+bf16 CE; confirms +12.7 % step regression pattern.

## Verdict

**REJECTED.** Permanently park the `async_collective_fusion*` flags at this scale. Exp 30 + 31 later confirmed `latency_hiding_scheduler` and `overlap_compute_collective_tc` are not the culprits in this bundle.
