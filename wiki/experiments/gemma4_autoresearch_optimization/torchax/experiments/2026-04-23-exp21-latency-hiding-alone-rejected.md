> *Backfilled from `RESULTS.tsv` + commit `b26e75c`.*

Enabled `--xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true` on the splash+fused_bwd best-config (batch=2). **−16.6 % step time.** Same regression pattern as the full bundle in exp 1 / exp 13.

## Hypothesis

Maybe the exp 1 / exp 13 regression was driven by the scheduler alone, not the `async_collective_fusion*` flags. Isolating might reveal the innocent.

## Result

Refuted — flag alone still regresses at this workload + this config.

> **Later correction**: [exp 30](2026-04-23-exp30-latency-hiding-solo-potential.md) ran the same flag at the newer exp 25 stack (batch=3, SEQ_MINOR, block=1024) and found it **flat**. The exp 21 regression is therefore specific to the batch=2 stack snapshot — possibly interacting with some other diff in the config. The authoritative verdict on `latency_hiding_scheduler` is "flat in isolation" per exp 30. Keep exp 21 parked as a curious data point.

- **Steps captured**: 10, 11, 12
- **What's inside**: xprof trace — `--xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true` alone on splash+fused_bwd best (batch=2); regressed −16.6 % step time at this stack snapshot. Superseded by exp 30 at exp-25 stack where the same flag is flat.

## Verdict

**REJECTED** at the time; effectively **INCONCLUSIVE** in light of exp 30's later flat result. Not merged.
