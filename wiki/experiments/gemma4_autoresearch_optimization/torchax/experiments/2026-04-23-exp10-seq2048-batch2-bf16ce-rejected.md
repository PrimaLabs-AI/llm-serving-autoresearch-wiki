Tried seq=2048 batch=2 with bf16 CE (which saves ~2 GiB fp32 logits). **Crashed at compile time: `CompileTimeHbmOom` — 32.49 G vs 31.25 G limit, over by 1.25 GiB.**

## Hypothesis

bf16 CE saves enough HBM to promote seq=2048 from batch=1 (exp 9) to batch=2, doubling tokens/step.

## Result

Compile-time HBM exceeded by **1.25 GiB**. First data point on the **~1.25 GiB XLA compile-overhead pattern** that recurred across exp 11, 22, 23, and 32.

- **Steps captured**: none (run did not reach training steps)
- **What's inside**: No runtime trace — compile-time HBM OOM (32.49 G vs 31.25 G limit). Directory holds the crash log and HLO dump fragment only.

## Verdict

**REJECTED — crash.** Not merged. The memory saving from bf16 CE wasn't enough to close the gap. Next attempt (exp 11) tried host-offload remat to break the compile-time budget; also failed.
