> *Backfilled from `RESULTS.tsv` + commits `1b0276f`, `eb4db37`.*

Monkey-patched `Gemma4RMSNorm.forward` to call pallas-forge's Pallas RMSNorm kernel via `torchax.interop.call_jax`. **Crashed on backward: pallas-forge's kernel has no `custom_vjp` registered, so `jax.grad` cannot differentiate through it. Error: "Linearization failed to produce known values".** Parked.

## Hypothesis

pallas-forge advertises a "Fused RMSNorm + Residual" kernel with 3.44× speedup vs XLA on v5e. If the same holds on v6e-4 and we can swap it into Gemma 4's RMSNorm call sites, the memory-bound `loop_fusion` bucket should shrink.

## Why it failed

pallas-forge exposes a forward kernel but not a backward. For a training workload, forward-only is unusable — the jit trace fails at `jax.value_and_grad` time.

## Profile

- **xprof browser URL**: [2026-04-23-gemma4-exp20-pallas-rmsnorm](http://localhost:8791/?run=2026-04-23-gemma4-exp20-pallas-rmsnorm) — opens the interactive trace viewer for this run.
- **Run name** (as listed by `mcp__xprof__list_runs`): `2026-04-23-gemma4-exp20-pallas-rmsnorm`
- **On-disk directory**: [`raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-exp20-pallas-rmsnorm/`](../../../../../raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-exp20-pallas-rmsnorm/) (gitignored; relative link click-throughs open the trace folder locally)
- **Steps captured**: none (run did not reach training steps)
- **What's inside**: No runtime trace — run crashed on backward trace (`Linearization failed to produce known values`) because pallas-forge RMSNorm lacks `custom_vjp`. Directory holds the forward-compile HLO dump.

## Verdict

**REJECTED / INVALID.** Not merged. The kernel itself may be correct; it just can't be used for training without a hand-rolled backward. That's what [exp 33](2026-04-23-exp33-pallas-rmsnorm-rejected.md) later delivered (and refuted for a different reason — XLA was already fusing RMSNorm with neighbor matmuls).
