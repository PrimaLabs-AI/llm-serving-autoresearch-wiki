Cross-point experiment: take [exp 12](2026-04-23-exp12-bf16-ce-accepted.md)'s splash+bf16 CE stack and apply it to seq=2048 b=1 instead of seq=1024 b=2. Result: **31,960 TPS at 256.3 ms/step** — saves ~2.5 % step time vs [exp 9](2026-04-23-exp9-splash-seq2048-accepted.md)'s fp32 CE version (263 ms).

## Hypothesis

bf16 CE should work the same at seq=2048 as at seq=1024. Matrix-fill data point.

## Result

Confirmed. TPS 31,960 — just below exp 12's 32,340 on the same total tokens/step (8192 for both: 2×1024 at b=2 and 1×2048 at b=1). seq=1024 b=2 edges seq=2048 b=1 by ~1.2 %.

- **Steps captured**: 10, 11, 12
- **What's inside**: xprof trace — splash + bf16 CE at seq=2048 b=1; saves ~2.5 % step time vs exp 9's fp32 CE.

## Verdict

**SUPPORTED.** Merged to trunk. Long-seq users get bf16 CE for free.
