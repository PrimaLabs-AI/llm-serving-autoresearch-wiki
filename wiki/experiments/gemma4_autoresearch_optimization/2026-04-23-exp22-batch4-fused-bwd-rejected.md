Tried batch=4 on the splash+fused_bwd+bf16 CE stack. **OOM at compile time by ~1.25 GiB — same ceiling pattern as exp 10, 11, 23, and later exp 32.**

## Hypothesis

fused_bwd's memory footprint might be smaller than non-fused bwd (one kernel's scratch vs three). Maybe it buys enough to reach batch=4.

## Result

OOM by the familiar 1.25 GiB. The ceiling is XLA's compile-time planner, not kernel scratch — fused_bwd doesn't change that. batch=4 on 1D fsdp=4 at seq=1024 on v6e-4 is fundamentally blocked by peak-activation accounting, not by the kernel choice.

## Verdict

**REJECTED — crash.** Not merged. Batch=4 would require either (a) less activation memory (more aggressive remat with compile-time visibility), (b) tensor-parallel weight sharding (refuted by [exp 32](2026-04-23-exp32-2d-mesh-tp2-rejected.md)), or (c) more HBM (hardware change).
