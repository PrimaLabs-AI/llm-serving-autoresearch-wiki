Tests the standard **async-collective-fusion + latency-hiding-scheduler** XLA flag bundle on the Gemma 4 E4B torchax FSDP baseline. The [2026-04-22 baseline](2026-04-22-baseline.md) showed ~10–15 % of step time in all-gather / all-reduce-scatter / all-reduce plus ~60 ms of `async-collective-done` wait. The hypothesis was that overlapping these with compute would shave 5–10 % off step time. **It regressed by 25 %.**

## Hypothesis under test

**Statement**: Enabling `--xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler` + `--xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion` + the multi-step / fuse-all-gather variants will reduce per-step wall-clock on Gemma 4 E4B at seq=1024, batch=1, FSDP=4 on v6e-4 by **5–10 %** without changing the loss trajectory.

Originates from [async-collectives](../../concepts/async-collectives.md), [latency-hiding-scheduler](../../concepts/latency-hiding-scheduler.md), and hypothesis #9 on the [program page](README.md).

## Setup

- Hardware: 4 × TPU v6 Lite (same host as baseline).
- Conda env: `gemma4_py313` (unchanged).
- Flags delta vs [2026-04-22 baseline](2026-04-22-baseline.md):
  - `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS="--xla_tpu_scoped_vmem_limit_kib=131072 --xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true --xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion=true --xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion_fuse_all_gather=true --xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion_multiple_steps=true"` (5 flags set; baseline set none).
  - One attempted flag `--xla_tpu_overlap_compute_collective_comms=true` was rejected by libtpu 0.0.40 (`Unknown command line flag`); dropped before the final run. **Post-hoc:** the real flag is `--xla_tpu_overlap_compute_collective_tc` (my mental cache had the wrong suffix). Confirmed by symbol-dumping `libtpu.so` (`strings libtpu.so | grep xla_tpu_overlap_compute_`). libtpu 0.0.40 IS the latest version (verified against PyPI, libtpu-lts-releases, libtpu-nightly-releases — nightlies stalled at `0.0.9.dev20250207`). No version upgrade available; only rename the flag.
  - Also tried the same flags in `XLA_FLAGS` first — `F0423 01:13:12.780461 999760 parse_flags_from_env.cc:234] Unknown flags in XLA_FLAGS`. **`--xla_tpu_*` flags go in `LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS`, not `XLA_FLAGS`.**
- Command:

  ```bash
  LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS="--xla_tpu_scoped_vmem_limit_kib=131072 \
    --xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true \
    --xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion=true \
    --xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion_fuse_all_gather=true \
    --xla_tpu_enable_async_collective_fusion_multiple_steps=true" \
  python -m train --steps 20 --batch_size 1 --seq_len 1024 \
    --profile_dir raw/profiles/2026-04-23-gemma4-exp1-async-collectives \
    --profile_steps 10 11 12
  ```

- **Steps captured**: 10, 11, 12
- **What's inside**: xprof trace — async-collective XLA flag bundle; HLO-op diff vs baseline shows the compute-fusion bytes explosion.

## Observations

1. **The collectives themselves did get slightly faster.** all-gather −5 ms, all-reduce-scatter −9 ms. So the flags did what they advertise at the collective level.
2. **But compute fusions regressed heavily.** convolution fusion +178 ms (+2.5× memory traffic), loop fusion +185 ms (+1.9× memory traffic). The scheduler's reordering broke the compute-side memory locality that the baseline had by default — many more materializations to HBM.
3. **Bytes accessed for every collective went up too** (all-gather 1→16 GiB, all-reduce-scatter 2→12 GiB). The fused variants are communicating more bytes, likely because the scheduler deferred them further from their consumers, forcing larger live tensors.
4. Compile time grew ~7 % (149.5 → 159.4 s per compile). The fused scheduler has more work to do. Not a dominant concern since it's one-time-ish (well, two-time — step-0 + step-1 recompile is still open).
5. **Loss trajectory is identical within bf16-reorder noise.** No correctness change. The verdict is purely performance-refuted, not invalid.
6. **The async-collective-done wait time from the baseline (~64 ms summed across `custom fusion`) was real.** Exp1 did reduce that per-op, but the cost was paid elsewhere. Net loss.

### Likely mechanism

The stock XLA scheduler for this workload produced a good compute-ordered schedule because the workload is small (batch=1, seq=1024), fitting comfortably. Enabling async-collective fusion + latency-hiding gave the scheduler more freedom to reorder; it chose reorderings that fused collectives but pushed convolution/loop fusions apart from their consumers, forcing extra HBM traffic.

This matches the xprof-mcp TPU optimization guide's caveat that these flags are "workload-dependent" — useful at scale, not universally.

## Verdict

**REFUTED.** The hypothesis predicted a 5–10 % wall-clock reduction; the measurement shows a **25 % wall-clock regression** and a **~1 GiB/step increase in total bytes accessed**. Correctness preserved (loss trajectory matches within numerical noise).

Valid as evidence at **seq=1024, batch=1, FSDP=4, v6e-4** only. At larger effective batch (seq ≥ 2048 once NaN is fixed, or batch > 1 once memory permits via remat), the balance between collective-overlap wins and scheduler-reorder losses may flip. Keep the hypothesis parked rather than retired — revisit once **#6 (selective remat)** or **NaN fix** unlocks larger configs.

## Next hypotheses

1. **Fix step-1 recompile** (~150 s/run savings; pure tooling). Mechanical: pass explicit `in_shardings` / `out_shardings` to `jax.jit` in `train.py` so step 1's donation path hits the step-0 cache key. Highest ROI for iteration speed on this program.
2. **Selective rematerialization** (hypothesis #6 on [README](README.md)). Memory pressure on baseline was 95 % HBM; remat frees activations, unlocks larger batch, which is where the async-collective flags might actually pay off.
3. **Fix NaN at seq≥2048** (hypothesis #0' / prereq). Cast logits to fp32 before log-softmax; if that doesn't fix it, compare per-layer hidden-state stats to localize the overflow.
4. **Revisit async-collective flags at larger effective batch** once #2 or #3 lands.
