Streams K/V chunks around a ring of devices so each device holds only `1/N` of the sequence in memory; enables sequence lengths beyond single-device HBM. Naive causal-masked Ring Attention wastes ~50% of compute on the lower triangle; **Zig-Zag Ring Attention** (Brandon et al. 2023) rebalances. TPU kernel exists at `tokamax/_src/ops/experimental/...ring_attention_kernel` but is **not reachable** from `tokamax.dot_product_attention` at this commit — hypothesis surface.

*Stub — expand when a hypothesis or experiment needs this concept in depth.*
