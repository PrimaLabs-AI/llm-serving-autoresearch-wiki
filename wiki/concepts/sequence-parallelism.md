Companion to tensor parallelism: shards the non-matmul ops (LayerNorm, Dropout, residual) along the sequence axis so their activation memory scales with `sp_size`. Replaces the TP block's internal `all_reduce` with a `reduce_scatter` + `all_gather` pair of the same aggregate volume — no extra communication, reduced activation memory. In JAX this falls out of a `PartitionSpec` over the sequence axis.

*Stub — expand when a hypothesis or experiment needs this concept in depth.*
